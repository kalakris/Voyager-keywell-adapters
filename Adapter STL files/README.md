# Voyager keywell adapters STL files

If you are ordering these adapters to be printed for you, you may need STL files rather than 3mf files. This is doable, but there are a lot of different individual models to coordinate, so be sure to double-check your order. Below is a diagram of the Voyager rows and columns labeled according to the stl file names.

A complete set of adapters for both halves of the Voyager will need these parts:
- 2x Left -1
- 2x Left 0
- 2x Left 1
- 2x Left 2
- 2x Right -1
- 2x Right 0
- 2x Right 1
- 2x Right 2
- 8x Middle -1
- 8x Middle 0
- 8x Middle 1
- 8x Middle 2

Use the Middle_0_deeper.stl file instead of the original Middle_0.stl file for the home row buttons if you find that they fall out of the original adapter too easily.
